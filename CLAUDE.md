# CLAUDE.md — QM Collections Explorer

Project-level guidance, auto-loaded each session. This is the **specific truth for
this folder**; the workspace file at `~/Documents/Claude/CLAUDE.md` holds the broader
working philosophy (Explore → Plan → Code → Commit, biodiversity context, Lily's
profile). Read both. For where the project is and what's next, read `docs/ROADMAP.md`;
the Phase 3 creative spec is `docs/BROWSE-REDESIGN-BRIEF.md`. To start a fresh session,
`docs/KICKOFF.md` has a ready-to-paste kickoff prompt.

## What this is

A single-file, **no-build, keyless static web app** for exploring Queensland Museum's
natural-history collections via the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), enriched with
GBIF, iNaturalist, Wikipedia, and Queensland Government / Geoscience Australia spatial
services. Deployed on GitHub Pages: <https://lily-lmk.github.io/QM-Explorer>.

- `index.html` — the entire app (~6,300 lines: HTML + CSS + JS inline). No framework,
  no build step. External deps (Leaflet, fonts) load via CDN.
- `sw.js` — optional service worker: caches CDN assets + API responses. App runs
  without it.
- `README.md` — architecture, data sources, deployment, caching.
- `docs/` — planning briefs and the ALA bug report (see "Current chapter").

Five views: **Records, Taxa, Browse, Map, Analytics**, plus CSV export. All ALA
queries are scoped to QM via `institution_uid:in15` (state field `S.alaInst`).

## How to run / verify

There is no build. Serve the folder over http (NOT `file://`, or the service worker
and some fetches misbehave):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000      # then open http://localhost:8000
```

…or use the VS Code **Live Preview** extension (right-click `index.html` → Show
Preview). Verify by clicking through the real UI and watching the browser console +
network tab. **Dev note:** `sw.js` caches aggressively — if a change doesn't show,
hard-reload (Cmd+Shift+R) or DevTools → Application → Service Workers → "Update on
reload". After changing `sw.js`, bump the cache version (`qm-*-vN`) so old caches purge.

## ALA API constraints — READ BEFORE TOUCHING ANY ALA QUERY

These were discovered in June 2026 when the app started producing errors — they may be
long-standing API behaviours the app was inadvertently violating, or recent infrastructure
changes on ALA's side; the root cause is unknown. Violating them produces a browser error
that often surfaces as a misleading **"ALA 503"**.
`biocache-ws.ala.org.au/ws/occurrences/search` is the main endpoint.

1. **`pageSize` ≤ 100.** Larger → real HTTP 503. Use the constant `ALA_MAX_PAGE`.
   (`flimit`, the facet limit, is exempt.)
2. **Result window = 5000.** ALA serves nothing past index 5000
   (`startIndex + pageSize ≤ 5000`). Constant `ALA_MAX_RESULTS`.
3. **No deep-paging cursor.** The old `id:{lastId TO *}` cursor is dead (ALA stopped
   returning a queryable `id`); `cursorMark` is unsupported. To exceed 5000 you must
   **partition** the query — the Map uses a lat/long **quadtree** (`bgLoadAllPages`):
   count a tile, and if >5000 split into 4, else offset-page it, dedupe by uuid.
4. **CORS — the big one. NEVER AND-join filters into one `fq`.** ALA drops the
   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header when a single `fq` contains
   `A AND B AND …`; the browser then blocks the response (looks like "ALA 503").
   **Always send each clause as a SEPARATE `fq` param** via the helpers
   **`appendFQ(urlParams, clausesArray)`** or **`fqQS(clausesArray)`**. `curl` never
   sees this (it ignores CORS), so test in a real browser.
5. **Bulk download endpoint needs auth** (`/ws/occurrences/index/download` → 403) —
   not usable from this keyless app.
6. **Decision (do not re-litigate): keyless & purely static.** No API key, no proxy;
   we accept slower large downloads (they load incrementally). Only revisit if instant
   full loads of 100k+ datasets ever become a real need.

When a browser ALA call fails but `curl` succeeds, suspect the missing CORS header,
not a real outage.

## Key code patterns & pointers (`index.html`)

- **State:** one mutable object `S` holds all app state (`S.res`, `S.total`, `S.view`,
  `S.facets`, `S.allPts`, `S.mapPoly`, …).
- **Query building:** `alaBaseFQ(f)` returns an **array** of fq clauses. Turn it into a
  request with `appendFQ(u, alaBaseFQ(f))` — never `.join(' AND ')`.
- **Constants (top of script):** `ALA_MAX_PAGE=100`, `ALA_MAX_RESULTS=5000`,
  `MAP_POINT_CAP=50000`, `INIT_PAGE`, `FLIM`.
- **Search:** `doSearch()` (standard + polygon paths). Map deep-load: `bgLoadAllPages`
  (quadtree, retry/backoff, bounded concurrency, uuid dedupe). Polygon: `bgPolyScan`.
- **Common names (vernaculars):** `lookupVern` (GBIF + iNaturalist, thorough),
  `lookupVernFast` (rank-aware, cheaper), `_localVern` (curated dictionary), cached in
  `_vernCache`. Records/cards use `batchFetchVernaculars` / `fetchVernacular`. The Taxa
  tree uses `_fillTreeVern` with **lazy** resolution (IntersectionObserver +
  `_queueTreeVern` throttle) so big expansions don't hammer the APIs — reuse this
  pattern. **`lookupVern` is the shared resolver: it trusts `_localVern` and already
  applies `isGenericVern` to API results internally — never re-filter its output, or
  you blank correct curated names (the auto-populate at ~:4793 poisons family names
  into `_genericVernSet`).** `lookupSubfamilyVern` (genus→subfamily/tribe climb) now
  works (returns + caches).
- **Group images (Browse):** `resolveGroupImage(name, rank, opts)` resolves one
  representative image per taxonomic group through a **museum-first cascade** — QM
  specimen → another institution's preserved specimen (`basis_of_record:"PreservedSpecimen"`,
  `-institution_uid:in15`) → iNaturalist → Wikipedia → BIE → generated SVG placeholder.
  It **preloads each URL** (`_imgPreload`) and falls through on load failure, so the
  returned candidate is guaranteed to display; result cached in `_groupImgCache` (stores
  the in-flight promise; evicts placeholders/failures so a blip doesn't lock a group).
  `renderGuide` fills QM images via the existing batch pass, then for QM-empty tiles
  calls `resolveGroupImage(...,{skipQM:true})` **lazily** through `_queueGuideImg`
  (mirrors the Taxa tree's throttle). Every image carries provenance + attribution.
- **Service worker:** propagates real network/CORS failures (does NOT manufacture a
  synthetic 503); passes real upstream HTTP errors through with their true status.

## Conventions / house rules

- **CORS-safe `fq` always** (separate params). This is the #1 rule.
- **Responsible API use:** cache (in-page + SW), throttle, and lazy-load (resolve only
  what's visible). Public services are fragile — don't burst hundreds of requests.
- **Scientific integrity:** separate evidence from inference; preserve identifiers
  (catalogue numbers, uuids, taxonConceptID); show provenance/attribution; make common
  names **rank-appropriate** (a family tile shows the family's name, not a random
  species'); a blank beats a mislabel.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA):** keyboard nav, visible focus, labels, modal focus
  trap, honour `prefers-reduced-motion`. Accessibility is part of quality.
- **Single static file, no build.** Add libraries via CDN (like Leaflet). Keep it
  self-contained and deployable to GitHub Pages.
- **Honest UI states:** clear loading / empty / error states; don't disguise failures.

## Git workflow

- Branch for any non-trivial change (`git checkout -b <feature>`); keep `main`
  deployable (it's the live site).
- Small, focused commits with clear messages; verify in the browser before committing.
- Push only when Lily asks.

## Current chapter

**Building toward the Browse redesign** — full plan in `docs/ROADMAP.md`, Phase 3
creative spec in `docs/BROWSE-REDESIGN-BRIEF.md`. The whole Phase 2 foundation is now
done: the **image-resolution cascade** (#6, live on `main`) and the **holdings-stats
helper** (#7, on the `phase2-holdings-stats` branch, awaiting the phase-boundary merge).
Browse tiles resolve museum-first (QM specimen → another institution's preserved
specimen → iNaturalist/Wikipedia → generated placeholder), lazily, with provenance; and
`deriveHoldingsStats(facets, opts)` derives the per-group holdings story (counts, year
range, imaged + `imagedPct`, type specimens, states, collectors, basis, child richness).

**Next:** Phase 3 — the awwwards-level Browse experience, built in the roadmap's order:
#8 (reduced-motion baseline + holdings narrative + `guideFocus` in the URL hash), then
#9 (GSAP/Three.js motion layer on top), then #10 (virtualise large ranks). One commit
at a time, verifying each in-browser.

Also pending (non-code): send `docs/ALA-API-bug-report.md` to the ALA team.

## Recent state (June 2026)

All ALA breaking-change fixes are live (`pageSize` cap, 5000-window + map quadtree,
app-wide CORS `fq` fix, service-worker hardening). **Phases 0–2 are complete:** the
`?selftest` harness; the stabilisation fixes (`fetchQualityCounts` CORS, `lookupSubfamilyVern`
repaired, Browse vernaculars made rank-correct, two `_localVern` hotfixes); the
museum-first image cascade wired into Browse with lazy resolution + provenance; and the
`deriveHoldingsStats` helper (#7, on `phase2-holdings-stats`, not yet merged). Records,
the specimen modal, Taxa, and Browse (names **and** images) are all correct. The
remaining Browse work is the visual redesign itself (Phase 3), built on this foundation.
